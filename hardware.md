# Analog Calculator Using Op-Amps

# Abstract
This project explores the design and implementation of a basic analog calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations using operational amplifiers (Op-Amps). The goal is to illustrate analog computing principles through the construction of circuits based on the widely used 741 op-amp. Each arithmetic operation utilizes distinct op-amp configurations: summing amplifiers, differential amplifiers, and log/antilog amplifiers. The result demonstrates real-time signal processing capabilities of analog computation with minimal components.
# Introduction
Analog computing, though largely eclipsed by digital processing in mainstream applications, remains relevant in niche areas such as signal conditioning, real-time audio processing, and embedded analog control systems. This project seeks to revive the practical understanding of analog computation through the implementation of an analog calculator.

The project targets:
Introducing core op-amp configurations for arithmetic functions.
Demonstrating mathematical operations in real-time without digital conversion.
Applying theoretical electronics principles in practical circuit design.
The operational amplifier 741 is chosen due to its widespread availability, robustness, and educational value. Despite its limitations in speed and bandwidth, it provides an excellent platform for exploring analog signal operations.

# Circuit Diagrams and Working Principles
<br>**Addition Circuit: Summing Amplifier**</br>
Working Principle:

A summing amplifier in inverting mode takes multiple voltage inputs through resistors and produces an output proportional to the negative sum of those inputs.

Working:
The op-amp operates in the inverting mode, summing the current from each input:
V<sub>out</sub> = -R<sub>f</sub> &times; (V<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>2</sub> + ... + V<sub>n</sub>/R<sub>n</sub>)

**Subtraction Circuit**
Concept:
Based on a differential amplifier using both inverting and non-inverting terminals.

Design Highlights:

One voltage applied to the inverting input, the other to the non-inverting input.

Uses matched resistors (e.g., 4.7kΩ) to maintain unity gain.

Output is the difference between the two input signals.

Inference:
With careful resistor selection, the subtraction circuit yields an accurate difference between two inputs with high reliability.

<br>**Multiplication Circuit**<br>
Concept:
Achieved through a sequence of logarithmic and anti-logarithmic amplifier stages.

Design Stages:

Convert input voltages to logarithmic form.

Add the logarithmic signals.

Use an anti-log amplifier to convert the sum back to linear form, giving a product.

Inference:
This analog technique successfully multiplies two signals. It often incorporates transistors within the op-amp feedback loop to achieve exponential behavior.

## <h2>Calculation</h2>

<h3>1. Addition Circuit (Summing Amplifier)</h3>
<p>
The output voltage of an inverting summing amplifier is calculated using the formula:<br>
<b>V<sub>out</sub> = - (Rf / R) × (V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + V<sub>3</sub> + ...)</b><br>
Assuming all input resistors are equal (R) and Rf is the feedback resistor.
</p>

<h3>2. Subtraction Circuit (Differential Amplifier)</h3>
<p>
The output of the differential amplifier is given by:<br>
<b>V<sub>out</sub> = (R2 / R1) × (V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub>)</b><br>
For unity gain subtraction: R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 (commonly 4.7kΩ).
</p>

<h3>3. Multiplication Circuit (Log-Antilog Method)</h3>
<p>
Analog multiplication using logarithmic identities involves three stages:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Convert input voltages to their logarithmic equivalents using a log amplifier: <b>V<sub>log</sub> = log(V<sub>in</sub>)</b></li>
  <li>Sum the log values: <b>V<sub>sum</sub> = V<sub>log1</sub> + V<sub>log2</sub></b></li>
  <li>Pass the result through an antilog amplifier to get the product: <b>V<sub>out</sub> = antilog(V<sub>sum</sub>)</b></li>
</ol>
Thus, the final output approximates the multiplication of the input signals.
