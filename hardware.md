# Analog Calculator Using Op-Amps

# Abstract
This project explores the design and implementation of a basic analog calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations using operational amplifiers (Op-Amps). The goal is to illustrate analog computing principles through the construction of circuits based on the widely used 741 op-amp. Each arithmetic operation utilizes distinct op-amp configurations: summing amplifiers, differential amplifiers, and log/antilog amplifiers. The result demonstrates real-time signal processing capabilities of analog computation with minimal components.
# Introduction

# Circuit Diagrams and Working Principles

## Addition Circuit: Summing Amplifier
Working Principle:

A summing amplifier in inverting mode takes multiple voltage inputs through resistors and produces an output proportional to the negative sum of those inputs.

Working:
The op-amp operates in the inverting mode, summing the current from each input:
V<sub>out</sub> = -R<sub>f</sub> &times; (V<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub>/R<sub>2</sub> + ... + V<sub>n</sub>/R<sub>n</sub>)

## Subtraction Circuit
Concept:
Based on a differential amplifier using both inverting and non-inverting terminals.

Design Highlights:

One voltage applied to the inverting input, the other to the non-inverting input.

Uses matched resistors (e.g., 4.7kΩ) to maintain unity gain.

Output is the difference between the two input signals.

Inference:
With careful resistor selection, the subtraction circuit yields an accurate difference between two inputs with high reliability.

## <h2>Calculation</h2>

<h3>1. Addition Circuit (Summing Amplifier)</h3>
<p>
The output voltage of an inverting summing amplifier is calculated using the formula:<br>
<b>V<sub>out</sub> = - (Rf / R) × (V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> + V<sub>3</sub> + ...)</b><br>
Assuming all input resistors are equal (R) and Rf is the feedback resistor.
</p>

<h3>2. Subtraction Circuit (Differential Amplifier)</h3>
<p>
The output of the differential amplifier is given by:<br>
<b>V<sub>out</sub> = (R2 / R1) × (V<sub>2</sub> - V<sub>1</sub>)</b><br>
For unity gain subtraction: R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 (commonly 4.7kΩ).
</p>

<h3>3. Multiplication Circuit (Log-Antilog Method)</h3>
<p>
Analog multiplication using logarithmic identities involves three stages:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Convert input voltages to their logarithmic equivalents using a log amplifier: <b>V<sub>log</sub> = log(V<sub>in</sub>)</b></li>
  <li>Sum the log values: <b>V<sub>sum</sub> = V<sub>log1</sub> + V<sub>log2</sub></b></li>
  <li>Pass the result through an antilog amplifier to get the product: <b>V<sub>out</sub> = antilog(V<sub>sum</sub>)</b></li>
</ol>
Thus, the final output approximates the multiplication of the input signals.

## Result
The analog calculator circuits—addition, subtraction, and multiplication—were successfully designed and simulated using LTspice. In the addition circuit, the output waveform showed a clean inverted sum of the input voltages, confirming the accurate functioning of the inverting summing amplifier. The amplitude matched theoretical values based on resistor ratios, and the signal remained stable throughout the simulation. In the subtraction circuit, the differential amplifier produced an output representing the voltage difference between the two inputs. The use of equal-value resistors (4.7kΩ) ensured unity gain and minimal offset error, demonstrating high precision and linearity. For the multiplication circuit, the implementation involved converting the inputs to logarithmic signals, summing them, and then applying an anti-log operation to obtain a product signal. Although the output exhibited some nonlinearity due to ideal vs. practical behavior in the simulation, it validated the feasibility of analog multiplication using logarithmic principles. Across all circuits, the simulations closely aligned with theoretical predictions, proving that op-amp-based analog computation is effective for basic arithmetic functions when proper component selection and design are observed.
